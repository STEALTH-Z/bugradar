## What is niku?

niku is automatically scan custom-built apps, find business-critical security vulnerabilities, strengthen your web app security with application scanning and using multiple company sources to gather subdomains is critical to an organization’s attack surface visibility — but the process of obtaining all the information necessary through many sources can be overly complicated and time-consuming. Normalizing and correlating the data can also be a tremendous undertaking in addition to keeping up-to-date with API changes over time. However, automated niku tool gather the new subdomain information organizations need for accurate attack surface monitoring, allowing users to focus their energy on be first attacker.

niku monitoring over
+ 1437+ public hackerone program
+ 460+ private hackerone program
+ 135+ bugcrowd program
+ 51+ self-hosted program
+ 8 intigriti program and checking 3 platform

niku streamlines both the processes of data collection and continuous monitoring, automatically triggering notifications via Telegram when program’s new subdomain is detected. Taking the automation a step further, this help security operations run more efficiently through integration with vulnerability scanners to support incident response and overall information security risk management.

### Features
+ 100% cloud-based
+ continous monitoring with change notifications by Telegram
+ multiple targets simultaneously scan with multiple-vps 
+ (20 workers - adding new servers as it possible)
+ 20x faster results with big scope
+ advanced vulnerable scanning
+ updating every day to new exploits
+ SQLite back-end for custom querying
+ highly configurable
+ actively developed
* your time should be focused on creating something amazing.
* you shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like parse scopes, save active domains, scan vulnerabilities and more..
* you should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ♥‿♥

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Golang](https://go.dev)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
