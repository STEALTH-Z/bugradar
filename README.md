## What is niku?

niku is automates the entire process of reconnaisance, find business-critical security vulnerabilities, strengthen your web app security with application scanning with designed to delegate time consuming tasks to the cloud by distributing the input data to multiple serverless functions and running the tasks in parallel resulting in huge performance boost. Normalizing and correlating the data can also be a tremendous undertaking in addition to keeping up-to-date with API changes over time. However, automated niku tool gather the new subdomain information organizations need for accurate attack surface monitoring, allowing users to focus their energy on be first attacker.

niku monitoring over
+ 4000+ public hackerone program
+ 460+ private hackerone program
+ 135+ bugcrowd program
+ 51+ self-hosted program
+ 8 intigriti program and checking 3 platform

niku streamlines both the processes of data collection and continuous monitoring, automatically triggering notifications via Telegram when program’s new subdomain is detected. Taking the automation a step further, this help security operations run more efficiently through integration with vulnerability scanners to support incident response and overall information security risk management.

### Features
+ distribute a scan of a large set of targets across 300-1000 instances within minutes and get results extremely quickly.
+ continous monitoring with change notifications by Telegram
+ updating every day to new exploits
+ SQLite back-end for custom querying
+ find S3 buckets and dump their buckets
+ highly configurable
+ actively developed
* your time should be focused on creating something amazing.
* you shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like parse scopes, save active domains, scan vulnerabilities and more..
* you should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ♥‿♥

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
